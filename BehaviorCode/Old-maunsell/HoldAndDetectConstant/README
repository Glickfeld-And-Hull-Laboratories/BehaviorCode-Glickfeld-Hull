121203 histed : Laser baseline notes  
        - laserBaselinePower is different from laserOffPower: baseline means open the shutters wide as soon as the parameters are received.
        - laserBaselinePower: different from trialLaser because it has a variable-intensity (controlled by stimOdds) waveform on top of it
        - baseline can be 0 - baseline functionality off, or positive.  If positive, the laserPeak can be bigger or smaller than it, which will result in positive or negative excursions

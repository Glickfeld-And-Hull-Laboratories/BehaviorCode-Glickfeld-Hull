%EUCLID_DIST (ps-utils): n-d euclidian distance between points
%    D = EUCLID_DIST(X1,X2) returns the distance between the corresponding
%    points in the vectors X1 and X2.  X1 and X2 are vectors of size (n,m) 
%    where n is the number of points, m is the number of dimension in the
%    euclidian space.  For X1 and X2, each row is a single point.  
%    In two dimensions, X1 and X2 are of size (n,2), the first column is 
%    the x value and the second the y value.
%    D has size (n,1).

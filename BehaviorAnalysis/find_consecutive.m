% OLD COMMENTS: from when I was trying to get this to work with
% matrices, not just vectors.  That should happen in the future but
% will require substantial work.  
%
% NOTES
%  runs cannot extend from one row to the next.
%
% EXAMPLES
%  inmatrix = [ 0  0  0  1  2  3  3;
%               0  4  8 10 12 14 24;
%              25 26 27 20  0  0  0 ];
%
%  find_consecutive (inmatrix, 1): starti = [ 3  7 ]
%                                  endi   = [ 9 16 ]
%  find_consecutive (inmatrix, 0): starti = [ 1 16 15 ]
%                                  endi   = [ 7 19 21 ]
%  find_consecutive (inmatrix, 2): starti = [ 5  ]

function m = madm(x)
%MADM (utils-general): Median absolute deviation from median
%   M = MEDIANAD(X)
%   For vector X, M is const*median(abs(x-median(x))).
%   For matrix X, M is a row vector containing the mad over each column.
%   
%   NaNs are _ignored_.
%
%   const = 1.4826 which is a bias correction factor:  The corrected madm is
%   asymptotically 1 for standard normal variables.  (while the uncorrected
%   madm is asymptotically 1/1.4826 = norminv(0.75), because the madm should
%   converge to the 75th percentile of a distribution).  The corrected madm
%   thus approximates the standard deviation of normal rv's.
